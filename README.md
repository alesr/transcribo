# Transcribo

Transcribo is  side project I've been messing around with. It's an app for extracting audio from media files and generate subtitles and transcripts using OpenAI Whisper API. At this point is more of an experiment of using Fyne to implement GUI apps in Go.

This is still a *work in progress*, and I've only tested it on macos so far. But if you wanna give it a try, just clone the repo, set your OpenAI key, and run the main.go file. Should be pretty straightforward.
